                     <h1><strong>Music</strong></h1>
              


                 <h2><strong>Etymology</strong></h2>
                   <p>The word <em>music</em> is derived from Ancient <strong>Greek</strong> μουσική (mousike) '(art) of the Muses'.[3] In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term music is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica 'the art of music', also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish música, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived from the "...Greek mousike (techne) '(art) of the Muses,' from fem. of mousikos 'pertaining to the Muses,' from Mousa 'Muse' (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term 'music' refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."[8][better source needed]</p>

                   <h3>theory</h3>
                   <p> <em>Music</em> theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the language and notation of <strong>music</strong>. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the parameters or elements of music – rhythm, harmony (harmonic function), melody, structure, form, and texture. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.[10] People who study these properties are known as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Some have applied acoustics, human physiology, and psychology to the explanation of how and why music is perceived. Music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.</P>
